In this paper, a new method, topic-aware propagation, is proposed to estimate topic-aware sentiment values for nodes in Chinese ConceptNet. One contribution is that we propose separating neighbors by topics before propagation. The result shows that it performs better than running propagation directly. Another contribution is that we deal with the problem that the sentiment of concepts should depend on texts. Our topic-aware propagation can assign each concept different sentiment values on different topics. When predicting polarities for texts, our system will output the most possible topics and sentiment values for concepts in texts. 

In the experiment of predicting polarities for microblog posts, we simply apply negation rules and sum up sentiment values of concepts. However, a more elegant approach can be designed to utilize the topics and sentiments of concepts outputted by our system.
